## Current State

UniQuant is a Python 3.12+ quantitative trading platform for China's A-share market. It covers market data ingestion, data lake storage, signal generation, factor research, risk management, backtesting/matching, service orchestration, reports, and a Streamlit dashboard.

The repository is past the historical "migration target" phase. The eight declared runtime layers are present under `src/uniquant/`:

`shared -> data -> brain/risk/signal -> hands -> services -> ui`

Current worktree snapshot from 2026-06-30 (post-Phase-6-remediation):

| Metric | Current value |
|---:|---:|
| Python files under `src/uniquant/` | 254 |
| Python LOC under `src/uniquant/` | 63,125 |
| Test files under `tests/` | 120 |
| Approximate test functions | 1,437 |

Phase 5 + Phase 6 complete. Full stock test (5934 stocks) completed 2026-06-30 — **5934/5934 pipeline success (100%) — Phase 6 validation: no regression**. All engines operational (LPPL, CZSC, Alpha, Regime). 5 pre-existing test failures unchanged (survivorship_warning + unified_matching). Market regime detected as FROZEN — all decisions FORCE_WAIT (expected, no signals generated during low-volatility regime). Engine distributions identical pre/post Phase 6 (LPPL Safe 53.8%/Danger 37.1%/Warning 9.1%, CZSC normal 94.1%/3rd_buy 5.9%).

| Metric | Phase 4 | Phase 5 | Phase 6 validation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tests passing | 1,363 | 1,410 | 1,426 |
| Test failures | 12 (wyckoff) + 5 (pre-existing) | 5 (pre-existing only) | 5 (pre-existing only) |
| Test files | 115 | 119 | 120 |
| Test functions | ~1,354 | 1,419 | 1,437 |
| Source LOC | 62,816 | 63,109 | 63,125 |
| Pipeline success (5934 stocks) | — | **100%** (5934/5934) | **100%** (5934/5934) — no regression |

## Core Runtime Flow

Single ticker research path:

1. `ServiceContainer.initialize()` constructs data, cache, analysis, signal, backtest, and research pipeline services.
2. `DataService.fetch_for_brain()` returns `data_pack` with stock data and metadata.
3. `AnalysisService.run_ticker_analysis()` runs regime, LPPL, NTF, CZSC, Wyckoff, alpha, and derived indicator logic.
4. `DecisionBrain` produces the final decision payload.
5. `TradingSignalCollector` converts engine outputs into typed `TradingSignal` objects.
6. `UnifiedBacktestEngine.run()` executes signals against K-line data using A-share constraints.
7. `PipelineResult` returns `data_pack`, decision, signals, and `BacktestResult`.

## Phase 0-6 Completion Status

All phases verified: **1426 tests pass, baseline 100% consistent**. 5 pre-existing failures in survivorship_warning + unified_matching.

| Phase | Scope | Status | Key deliverables |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | LPPL SELL priority, baseline tooling | ✓ | `unified_engine.py` SELL-before-BUY fix, `tests/benchmark/golden_20.txt`/`golden_100.txt`, `scripts/capture_baseline.py` + `compare_baseline.py` |
| **1.1–1.2** | BacktestResult metadata, typed contracts | ✓ | `BacktestResult.metadata`, `RealTimeProvider`, `FrozenTimeProvider`, domain events, `FactorManifest`/`FactorRegistry` |
| **1.4** | Feature flags, config models | ✓ | `RefactoringConfig`, `FeatureFlags`, `config.yaml` refactoring section, `ServiceContainer` DI |
| **2** | SignalArbitrator, TimeProvider adoption | ✓ | `SignalArbitrator` (sell-priority, confidence-based), 7 tests, pipeline integration, `FactorRegistry` admission gate |
| **3** | 6-engine typed output migration | ✓ | `RegimeOutput`, `LPPLOutput`, `NtfOutput`, `CZSCOutput`, `WyckoffOutput`, `AlphaOutput`, `DecisionOutput`, `MarketSignalContext` direct pass |
| **4** | Pipeline typing, engine output typing, batch parallelization | ✓ | `ResearchDataPack` + feature flag in pipeline & analysis & data services; 4 engines return typed outputs; `run_batch()` ThreadPoolExecutor + atomic checkpoint; `factor_gate: "block"` |
| **5** | Remediation — 7 threads (A–G) via TDD | ✓ | `use_research_data_pack` default flipped to `true`; Wyckoff 12 failures fixed; TradeCalendar AkShare auto-update; ResultStore persistence; DataFetcher single entry; BacktestResult.compare(); dead code cleanup; **Full stock test: 5934/5934 success (100%)** |
| **6** | Regime reliability — fail-open fix, dead code, TOCTOU | ✓ | `RegimeDetector.detect()` fail-open hardened (entropy/turnover NaN → UNKNOWN); `_validate_input_data()` wired; `_check_sell_conditions` FROZEN dead code removed; `MarketLevelCache.get_or_compute_regime()` TOCTOU fix; 16 new tests |

**Design**: All typed outputs coexist with legacy `Dict[str, Any]` keys for backward compatibility. Feature flags default ON for `use_research_data_pack` (flipped Phase 5 Thread A). `factor_gate: "block"` prevents unregistered factors.

## Working Rules For Agents

- Start with current source code, not historical docs.
- Before meaningful multi-file work, create a short plan.
- Prefer narrow analysis and narrow edits.
- Do not revert user or prior-agent changes.
- Treat the working tree as possibly dirty. Inspect `git status --short` before edits.
- Use `rg` and `rg --files` for searches.
- Use `apply_patch` for manual file edits.
- For code changes, follow TDD where practical: identify failing path, add/update tests, implement, verify.
- For sensitive paths, review auth, data validation, injection risk, secrets, and error leakage.
- After meaningful changes, review the diff and record verification performed.
- **Sync docs with every change**: After any code modification (feature, refactor, bugfix), update `AGENTS.md` and all affected documentation under `docs/`. At minimum refresh file counts, LOC, test counts, and phase status. Treat documentation drift as a blocker, not a backlog item.

## Analysis Workflow

For systematic system analysis, use:

`docs/ANALYSIS_PROMPT_PLAYBOOK.md`

It defines stages 0-7:

0. Global architecture
1. Services orchestration
2. Data system
3. Brain engines
4. Factor system
5. Signal system
6. Backtest and matching
7. Risk and live-readiness

Each stage requires a plan, concrete artifacts, checkpoint context, and verification checklist.

## Known Gaps (Post-Phase 5) — Full Plan in `docs/GAP_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`

> **2026-06-12 update**: G-1 through G-4 have all been closed and verified in the institutional closure review. The gap table below is retained as historical reference. See `docs/analysis/institutional/17_institutional_closure_review_report.md` §Phase 6 Gap Review for the verified closure evidence.

| ID | Gap | Priority | Status (2026-06-12) | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G-1 | `TimeProvider` only deployed in 2 files; ~120 direct clock calls remain (`datetime.now`, `pd.Timestamp.now`, `time.time`) in 6 layers | P2 | ✅ **Closed** — 0 `pd.Timestamp.now`, 2 guarded `datetime.now`, 36 `time.time` for rate limiting | all layers |
| G-2 | Two `FactorRegistry` classes (shared/ governance with 0 users, brain/ de facto with 16 imports); admission gate is dead code | P1 | ✅ **Closed** — shared/ has deprecation warning; brain/ has `check_access()` + `set_mode()` + `FactorAccessLevel` | `shared/`, `brain/` |
| G-3 | Phase 0 deliverables (SELL priority, baseline scripts, golden lists, parquet data) exist only in working tree, never committed | **P0** | ✅ **Closed** — all files committed across 22-commit sequence | — |
| G-4 | EventBus is sync-only; no async variant blocks hot-path scaling | P2 | ✅ **Closed** — `AsyncEventBus` + `ThreadPoolExecutor` deployed; 9 async + 10 sync + 6 integration tests pass | `shared/` |

### Quick Start For New Tasks

| If working on... | Read this first | And be aware of |
|---|---|---|
| Time-dependent code | `shared/time_provider.py` + GAP_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md §G-1 | 2 guarded `datetime.now()` remain in `time_provider.py` FrozenTimeProvider fallback |
| Factor registration/access | `brain/factors/registry.py` (actual) NOT `shared/factor_governance.py` (dead code) | GAP_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md §G-2 — shared/ deprecated with warning |
| Baseline/regression testing | `scripts/capture_baseline.py` + `compare_baseline.py` | GAP_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md §G-3 — Phase 0 all committed |
| Event-driven features | `shared/event_bus.py` (sync) + `shared/event_bus.py` (async) | GAP_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md §G-4 — AsyncEventBus deployed with 9 tests |
| Pipeline typing / data pack | `shared/interfaces.py` `ResearchDataPack` + `services/analysis_service_v2.py` dual-path | Feature flag `use_research_data_pack: true` default (flipped Phase 5); `to_dict()` flattens `metadata` for signal collector |
| Engine output typing | `shared/interfaces.py` (LPPLOutput/CZSCOutput/NtfOutput/WyckoffOutput) + engine files in `services/analysis/` | 4 engines return typed outputs; field annotations in ResearchDataPack are forward references |
| Batch research | `services/research_pipeline.py` `run_batch()` | ThreadPoolExecutor + atomic checkpoint; input order preserved via result map |
| Research result persistence | `shared/result_store.py` + `services/research_pipeline.py` | JSON file store under `results/{date}/{symbol}.json`; ResultStore.save() called after each successful run() |
| TradeCalendar | `data/managers/trade_calendar_manager.py` | AkShare auto-update with stale cache check (>180 days); hardcoded 2024-2026 fallback |
| BacktestResult compare | `hands/backtest/unified_engine.py` `BacktestResult.compare()` | Returns diff dict for parameter sensitivity analysis |
| Full stock scan | `scripts/staged_full_scan.py` + `docs/remediation/FULL_STOCK_TEST_PLAN.md` | 3-stage scan (canary→medium→full); `--stage canary|medium|full`; checkpoint resume; per-engine breakdown; error classification |
| Regime detection safety | `brain/regime/regime_detector.py` fail-open paths | Phase 6: entropy/turnover NaN → UNKNOWN (was NORMAL); `_validate_input_data()` wired into `detect()` |
| Market cache TOCTOU | `services/market_cache.py` `get_or_compute_regime()` | Phase 6: atomic get-or-compute prevents parallel recompute in batch mode |
| FSM dead code | `brain/fsm/fsm.py` `_check_sell_conditions()` | Phase 6: FROZEN removed (unreachable — veto fires first); STRESSED only |
